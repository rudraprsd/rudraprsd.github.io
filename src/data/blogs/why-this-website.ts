I am into computer since I got a computer at home when I was around 5 years old. From that time I was always using computer for various purposes like playing games, MS Paint. My father had a C programming book (I don't remember the name) but that was very thick book. Then I got to know for this computer thing you need to study a lot. By that time, computer is rare in houses in India. Lots of young people use to come to our house to use computer and they taught me a lot of things. They used to save music videos, games from internet using dungle internet connection. I learnt typing using typing tutor software. Then slowly I increased my typing speed about 60 WPM. Impressive right. I know. That is practice. I did typed everyday for hours.

But after that from 4th standard to 12th standard, I stayed outside where I had no computer access. But still my interest for computer did not fade away.
After 12th, when I got into IISER, I started learning cpp, c, python, html, css, a little bit js etc. I also learnt how cpu works, dbms, machine learning, data structures and algorithms etc. I am not that guy who only into a particular field of coding that is web development or app development or game development. I like to explore all the fields of computer science. I also like to read research papers especially in machine learning, artificial intelligence etc. I love the machine learning field.
