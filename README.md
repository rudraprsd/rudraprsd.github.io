# 🚀 Personal Portfolio & AI Blog

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the repository behind my personal website. This is where I share my journey through the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

This site is my digital playground where I:

- **Share AI Insights** – Breaking down complex AI concepts into digestible pieces
- **Discuss Research Papers** – Deep dives into cutting-edge ML research
- **Showcase Projects** – Real-world AI/ML projects with interactive demos
- **Document My Learning** – Because the best way to learn is to teach

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies for a smooth, responsive experience:

- **React 18** – For building the UI
- **TypeScript** – Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite** – Lightning-fast build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** – Beautiful, accessible components

## 🎨 Why This Stack?

After experimenting with various platforms (Astro, MkDocs, Hugo, and even pure HTML/CSS), I landed on React + TypeScript. Why? Because it offers the perfect balance of:

- ⚡ Performance
- 🎨 Creative flexibility
- 🧩 Component reusability
- 📱 Responsive design out of the box
- 🔧 Easy maintenance
